# PlavaWebDraft

Code for one version of my Plava webapp. This can be run by installing flask then running main.py. This version, which uses an exhastive search, gives great results, but runs slowly for an input request of 
more than 3 days. Also note that this extends a general CSP solver codebase we were given to fill in during a project for CS221, so some code and comments are credited to CS221 staff, including much 
of cspSolver.py (it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel/backtracking search).
