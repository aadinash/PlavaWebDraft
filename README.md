# PlavaWebDraft

Some code for one version of my Plava webapp. Note that I have excluded the images in the static folder to save space. This can be run by installing flask then running main.py.
Also note that this extends a general CSP solver codebase we were given to fill in during a project for CS221, so some code and comments are credited to CS221 staff, including much 
of cspSolver.py (it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel/backtracking search).
